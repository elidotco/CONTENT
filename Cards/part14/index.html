                    “As I flew north to begin my third circuit of Iceland in
                    four years, I was slightly anxious. The number of visitors
                    to Iceland has doubled in that period, and I feared this
                    might mean a little less magic to go around. At the end of
                    this trip, 6000km later, I'm thrilled to report that the
                    magic levels remain high. It's found in glorious football
                    victories and Viking chants, kayaking among icebergs,
                    sitting with puffins under the midnight sun and crunching
                    across brand-new lava fields.”

                    smoked glass and brushed aluminium and while you won't be
                    tripping over artefacts – three decades of round-the-clock
                    development and rash town-planning have taken their toll –
                    rich seams of antiquity await.”

                    its staggering range of possibilities. Not many other
                    countries have so much natural beauty – mountains, beaches,
                    rainforest, deserts, canyons, glaciers – coupled with
                    fascinating cities to explore, an unrivaled music scene and
                    all the things that make travel so rewarding (friendly
                    locals, great restaurants and farmers markets, and plenty of
                    quirky surprises).”

                    “For me, Peru is the molten core of South America, a
                    distillation of the oldest traditions and the finest
                    building, weaving and art made by the most sophisticated
                    cultures on the continent. In Peru the wildest landscapes –
                    from frozen Andean peaks to the deep Amazon – help us
                    re-forge our connection to the natural world. It is also a
                    cultural stew, where diverse peoples live side by side,
                    negotiating modern life with humor and aplomb. Beyond that,
                    the cuisine alone makes it worth the trip. Every return is
                    rich and surprising.”
